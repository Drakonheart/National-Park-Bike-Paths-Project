# National-Park-Bike-Paths-Project

Design a program for a new National Park using doubly linked lists and an extended stack ADT to create optimal bike paths. Model park chambers, considering safety and topography. Implement DLStack.java and PathFinder.java to find paths from an entrance to treasures while avoiding sealed or dark chambers.

# CS 1027B: Computer Science Fundamentals II - National Park Bike Paths

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a program to build bike paths within a new National Park around the existing Pyramid Creek Falls Provincial Park in British Columbia. The program uses doubly linked lists, an extended stack ADT, and map traversal techniques to find optimal paths while considering park topography and safety.

## Project Objectives

- Implement doubly linked lists.
- Create an extended stack ADT using doubly linked lists.
- Develop an algorithm to find paths in a map using a stack.
  
## Project Details

- Model park spaces as interconnected hexagonal chambers.
- Differentiate chambers by characteristics such as lighted, dim, sealed, treasure, etc.
- Construct a program to find paths from the entrance chamber to treasure chambers, avoiding sealed or dark chambers.
- Implement classes `DLStack.java` and `PathFinder.java` with specified methods and constraints.

## Implementation Details

- **DLStack.java**: Implement an extended stack ADT using a doubly linked list.
- **PathFinder.java**: Implement methods to compute paths, mark chambers, and select optimal chamber transitions.
